# ZhuaTech Energy Management System

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for connected devices, edge operations, and multi-screen experiences.

ZhuaTech Energy Management System provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for connected devices, edge operations, and multi-screen experiences. It is designed for device operators, field teams, service managers, and platform administrators, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise energy management system, self-hosted energy management system, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Product Scope

- **Primary users:** Device operators, field teams, service managers, and platform administrators.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Capability Map

- **User** — Manage user with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **Asset** — Coordinate asset through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Spare Part** — Track spare part metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Maintenance Plan** — Preserve maintenance plan evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Work Order** — Expose work order in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Inspection Record** — Connect inspection record to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Technology Baseline

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Vue 3 · Vite · MySQL 8 · Docker Compose

### Repository Layout

- `backend/` — Java backend, domain services, APIs, validation, and automated tests
- `frontend/` — responsive user and administration interfaces
- `deploy/` — deployment and operations resources
- `docs/` — architecture, operations, screenshots, and supporting documentation
- `compose.yaml` — local multi-service orchestration

## Run Locally

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

- Review `compose.yaml` before changing published ports, storage paths, or production credentials.

## Verification

Run the checks supported by this repository before changing or deploying it:

```bash
cd backend && mvn test
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build
```

## Security and Production Readiness

- Never commit real passwords, API keys, tokens, certificates, customer data, or production connection strings.
- Replace all local demonstration credentials and secrets before deployment.
- Apply least privilege, tenant isolation, backup and restore drills, monitoring, rate limiting, and vulnerability management.
- Please report security issues privately through the contact channels below instead of publishing sensitive details.
